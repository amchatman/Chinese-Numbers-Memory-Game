### Summary

A Chinese number memory game made from Javascript is a game that challenges the player to match pairs of Chinese number characters displayed on cards. The player must flip over two cards at a time to find a matching pair. The game keeps track of how many matching pairs have been found and alerts the player when all pairs have been matched. The game also shuffles the cards randomly each time it is played to provide a new challenge for the player.
